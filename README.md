This repository comprises the project of the Computer Graphics course unit project. The goal was to create a supply delivery simulation using concepts learned in the course unit and WebGL.

The application consists of a supply delivery simulation made by a vehicle, in this case, a blimp. In order to support the concept the scene has to contain a surrounding landscape (cube map), a terrain, a vehicle and a billboard.

## How to play?

**WASD** - horizontal movement.

**L** - supply launch.

**P** - turn on/off auto-pilot.

**R** - reset scene.

## Requirements

#### WebCGF
WebCGF (Web Computer Graphics @ FEUP) is a library developed by teachers of the Graphics, Interaction and Gaming Group (GIG) of the Department of Informatics Engineering (DEI) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto to support the computer graphics courses lectured primarily in the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering (MIEIC).

You can download WebCGF and its documentation [here](https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~ruirodrig/pub/sw/webcgf/docs/#).
